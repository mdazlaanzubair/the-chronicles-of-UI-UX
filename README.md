# The Chronicles of UI/UX üìñ‚ú®

Hello and welcome to my portfolio website repository! Here, you'll find all my portfolio websites I've created so far. I've put together this repository to track my progress and growth in both design and development. You'll see how my skills have evolved over time, including improvements in design aesthetics, color selection, animations, coding, and folder organization. Enjoy exploring my work!

## Why I Made This üß≠

I made this to keep track of my progress as a developer. It helps me in a few ways:

- **Keep track of my design journey:** I can see how my understanding of good design has grown over time.
- **Remember what I‚Äôve learned:** Each website I created, teaches me something new and shows how the trends of that time influenced me.
- **Share my experience:** Maybe my journey can help others with their designs too.

## Take a Look Around üó∫Ô∏è

Feel free to explore the folders and see the code. Each website tells a part of my design story.
