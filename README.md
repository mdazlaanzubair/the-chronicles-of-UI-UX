# v1: Personal Portfolio Website

This is the first portfolio i have made almost 6 years back in `Dec 22, 2019`. It was a simple, static website built using basic `HTML`, `CSS`, and a touch of `JavaScript`. Looking back, it's a bit rudimentary, but it represents the start of my journey in web development. I remember being so excited to showcase my few initial **projects** and **skills**. The design was very basic, focusing mainly on a clean layout and easy navigation.
