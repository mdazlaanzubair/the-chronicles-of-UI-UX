      "The growing reliance on AI in Software Quality Assurance (SQA) necessitates a rigorous evaluation of AI models for TC generation. This study investigates whether the advanced reasoning capabilities of Open AI’s O1 series truly differentiate it from non reasoning models (Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) 4o) and human Quality Assurance (QA) engineers. To address this, we assessed the performance of 12 experimental groups, including human testers, eight variants of GPT 4o employing diverse prompt engineering techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought, few-shot, self-consistency), and three variants of the O1 model, in generating TCs for 11 software applications. A total of 3,682 TCs were evaluated using the mixtral-8x7B-32768 model against four criteria: Coverage, Clarity, Edge & Negative Cases (E/NC), and Non-Functional Coverage (NFC). Descriptive statistics demonstrated uniformly high coverage and strong clarity across groups, while the capture of edge, negative, and non-functional scenarios varied considerably. Statistical analyses via Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) (F ≈ 8.09, p ≪ 0.05) and pairwise t-tests revealed significant differences in quality scores, highlighting that both the underlying model architecture and the prompting strategy substantially affect the outcomes. Notably, AI models not only generated a greater number of TCs but also achieved a superior Quality-to-Quantity (QTQ) ratio compared to human engineers, even when provided with minimal contextual information. In conclusion, although reasoning models produce more structured outputs, their marginal performance improvements may not justify the higher computational costs. Enhanced prompt engineering enables non-reasoning models to offer an efficient and effective alternative for TC generation, thereby underscoring the potential for AI integration in optimizing software testing processes. To facilitate replication and further research, an extensive dataset and fully documented codebase are available at https://github.com/mdazlaanzubair/8x7b-nexus-test-gen.",
